  <p>SnackCheck: Your Guide to Healthier Snack Choices</p>

# About this project

In 2023, a Nielsen survey found that 75% of Indonesian households consume packaged foods, including snacks and ready meals. This is especially common among urban students (80%) and office workers (70%), who rely on convenience.

However, many of these foods contain harmful ingredients like excessive sugar, salt, and trans fats, contributing to health problems like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease‚Äîyet most consumers are unaware of the risks.

That‚Äôs where SnackCheck comes in. Our Android app helps users make healthier choices by providing simple, clear health assessments of packaged snacks. By entering nutritional data, users instantly see if the snack is healthy, how much to consume safely, and whether it‚Äôs okay for regular use.
SnackCheck stands out for its simplicity and practicality. In a world where people care about health but seek convenience, we bridge the gap with easy-to-understand insights that fit effortlessly into daily life.

Our goal is to make healthy living easier and more accessible, starting with Indonesians who consume packaged foods every day.üçè‚ú®
